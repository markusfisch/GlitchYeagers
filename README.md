Glitch Yeagers
==============

Air combat for [js13kGames][js13kgames] 2016.
Theme was "Glitch".

And here is it:
You may take a break from combat by escaping through the ground.
If you hit the ground *firing*, you get to the "other side" where
the world looks a bit differnt. Enemies cannot follow you there.
But remember to keep that fire button pressed to stay alive on
the other side.

Check out the original [entry][entry] or the post-compo [version][play].

Use the cursor keys to move, space to fire.
On a touch device, use one finger to move and two fingers to fire.
